# Introduction to statistical testing

## Statistical testing is young

Statistical hypothesis testing, or "significance testing", is one of the most widespread methods in science. If you pick up an article of _Science_ or _Nature_ and read any scientific article, there will almost certainly be a $p$-value in it. I put statistical tests after the incredibly fundamental concepts of observation, quantitation, and experimentation as the building blocks of contemporary science.

Of these fundamental scientific concepts, statistical testing is by far the youngest. In the Western scientific tradition, observation as a method goes back to Aristotle (b. 384 BC). Other ancient Greeks were using quantitative measurements and geometry to determine things like the diameter of the Earth. Experimentation may as we now think of it was championed by Francis Bacon (b. 1561 AD) but probably has much older roots. Our earliest examples of statistical hypothesis testing date to the 1700s ---one of the early examples will be explored in a later chapter--- but testing as we now understand it was formalized by Ronald Fisher (b. 1890), Jerzy Neyman (b. 1894), and Egon Pearson (b. 1895).

The fact that a young method, whose formalization is less than 100 years old, has permeated nearly all of science speaks to its intellectual appeal. I think it also clarifies why statistical testing and interpretation of $p$-values is such a controversial issue in contemporary science: we as a scientific community simply have not had enough time to fully digest the idea. Not only is the conceptual basis of statistical testing not fully refined, we have also not found the best ways to explain this concept to one another.

## Statistical inference is philosophically confusing

Not only is statistical testing a relatively young idea, but statistical inference as a conceptual approach is deeply entwined with some of the fundamental philosophical questions that underly probability theory. In my experience, the students and practitioners that are my target audience for this book are challenged by these philosophical problems of statistical inference just as much as they stuggle with the mathematical aspects of statistical testing!

Rather than sweep those philosophical questions under the rug, I will lay them out, to avoid confusion later.
