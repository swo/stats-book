\chapter{What is statistics?}

"Statistics" is confusing because it means two things. It's a plural noun that
refers to multiple things, each of which is called a "statistic". It's also a
singular noun that refers to the study of these mathematical objects.

Statistics is a tool.\footnote{I really enjoyed reading this anecdote from a
paper by Gene Glass, the inventor of meta-analysis (doi:10.1002/jrsm.1133).
Glass. He ends up sitting on the plane next to the famous statistician
Tukey. Tukey asks, "Along which dimension do you see the greatest
variability in effects?" By investigator. "Then jackknife on investigator."
The point is that there's a wide gap between being able to understand what
the jackknife is in a mathematical sense (i.e., how to compute it, whether
it's an unbiased way to determine the variance in the median) and how to apply
it. It also goes to show that "real" statisticians can be pretty hacky!}
